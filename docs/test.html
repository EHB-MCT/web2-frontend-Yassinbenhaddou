            <p class="aboutText">Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and due to 
                its proximity it is not easily 
                seen except during twilight. 
                For every two orbits of the Sun, 
                Mercury completes three rotations 
                about its axis and up until 1965 it was 
                thought that the same side of Mercury constantly faced the Sun. 
                Thirteen times a century Mercury can be observed from the Earth 
                passing across the face of the Sun in an event called a transit, 
                the next will occur on the 9th May 2016.
